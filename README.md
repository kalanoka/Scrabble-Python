# Scrabble Python 
This is a French Python implementation of the popular word game Scrabble. The game can be played in the Python shell, and it features a large dictionary of French words to choose from. It is also available in English, but the balancing will be off due to the frequency of English letters being different from those in French.

### Getting Started
To start playing the game, simply clone or download this repository and run the scrabble.py file in your Python environment. You will be prompted to enter the number of players and their names, and then the game will begin.

### Gameplay
Each round, players will draw seven letters from the Scrabble tile bag and use them to create words on the board. Points are awarded based on the length and complexity of the words created. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

### Features
- A large dictionary of French or English words to choose from
- Easy-to-use interface for entering words on the board
- Automatic scoring based on word length and complexity
- Support for multiple players
